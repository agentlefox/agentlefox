- 👋 Hi, I’m @agentlefox
- 👀 I’m interested in neurotechnology, more effective implementation of public policy, video game A.I., and perhaps more oddly U.X. development.
- 🌱 I’m currently (re)learning Java, C#, and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various things once I get myself more comfortable.
- 📫 How to reach me: A Discord is in Development
